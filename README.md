This project is a output-oriented and partly symbolic interpreter for the [PHP](http://php.net/) language and aims to expand [Varis](https://github.com/git1997/VarAnalysis)/Symex to basic class support as well as a plug-in system to add PHP standard library functions.

To build the project, clone the repository and use [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html) via `sbt compile`. To edit the project, use `sbt eclipse`.
